I kind of like this quote by Keynes. It makes me sound sophisticated.

If you need to know more about me, here are three websites that I try to keep up-to-date

* [My linked.in profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasilykartashov)
* [My GitHub account](https://github.com/vasily-kartashov/)
* [Mein XING Profil](https://www.xing.com/profile/Vasily_Kartashov)

## Important

I try to be professional and useful of this website, still it's nothing more than a programmer's notebook for my own amusement.

If you need to drop me a line try info@kartashov.com

Thanks for reading!
